# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This application is a digital version of the classic two-player board game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their symbol (either X or O) in an empty square. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the other player does.

This application allows players to compete against each other on a single device. The players can take turns placing their symbol by tapping on the desired square on the grid. The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen. In addition, the application provides an option to reset the game and start over if players wish to play again.

The application features a simple and intuitive user interface with attractive graphics and sound effects. It is easy to use, and players can quickly learn how to play the game. Overall, your tic-tac-toe application provides a fun and engaging way for players to enjoy the classic game of tic-tac-toe on their device.
